# For large files, we cannot use Spring Bootâ€™s default StandardServletMultipartResolver or CommonsMultipartResolver, 
# since the server has limited resources (disk space) or memory for buffering. 
# So we need to disable the default MultipartResolver and define our own MultipartResolver, which is present in the main application class.
